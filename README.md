# Signature Verification System


![Screenshot 2024-10-29 235631](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5edcdf8-59c8-4399-81f7-8025b82de10f)

Welcome to the Signature Verification System!

This project is designed to verify the authenticity of signatures through advanced image processing techniques. It utilizes Flask as the backend framework, complemented by HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, while MongoDB serves as the database.

The system enables users to compare signatures against stored reference images, employing models like VGG and ResNet for feature extraction and utilizing cosine similarity to assess authenticity.

To run this project, please follow the commands provided below. If you find this project valuable, we would greatly appreciate your support by giving it a star! We welcome any suggestions or collaboration inquiries.

## Project Overview

The **Signature Verification System** enables automatic verification of signatures. By uploading a signature image, the system will compare it with a set of pre-stored reference images using model algorithms (like VGG and ResNet) and provide a similarity score. The project aims to assist in validating signature authenticity in a secure, fast, and reliable manner.

---

## Features

- **Signature Upload**: Users can upload a signature image for verification.
- **Model Comparison**: Uses VGG and ResNet models to generate similarity scores.
- **Threshold-Based Results**: Displays results based on user-defined thresholds.
- **MongoDB Integration**: Stores reference images for verification purposes.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Displays loading status and final verification results dynamically.

---

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Flask
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Bootstrap for UI)
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **APIs**: RESTful APIs to handle image upload, verification, and result generation

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python** (>= 3.6)
- **MongoDB** (locally or as a service, e.g., MongoDB Atlas)
- **Flask** and other required packages (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

Clone the repository and navigate into the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tonmoy313/Signature_matching.git
cd Signature_matching
```

Install the necessary Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Ensure MongoDB is running on your local machine or connect to your MongoDB Atlas cluster.

### Running the Project

1. **Set up Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project directory.
   - Add the following variables to configure MongoDB, Flask's secret key, and API keys used for uploading and verifying signatures:

     ```plaintext
     UPLOAD_API_KEY=18daa167476e0a371966fa954ef38f79
     API_KEY_VERIFICATION=dc4b3f8464b89175b6a1bae401483fe0
     ```

     - **Note**: The API keys must match the values checked in `static/js/script.js` within the `uploadSignatures()` and `verifySignature()` functions.

2. **Change the Connection String**:
   - Replace the connection string in Database\connection.py
  
     
3. **Start the Flask Application**:
   - Run the project using:

     ```bash
     py app.py
     ```

---

   The project should now be running at [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000).

---

## Usage

1. **Access the Homepage**: Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
2. **Upload Signature for Verification**: Enter the person’s name, select a threshold, and upload a signature image.
3. **View Results**: After processing, view the results displayed in the modal with similarity scores for both models.
